His former Kimberley home houses the Sol Plaatje Educational Trust and Museum.\n\nThe Department of Basic Education lists Native Life in South Africa, published in 1916, and the novel Mhudi, published in 1930. It also describes his Setswana writing and Shakespeare translations. Language was part of his public work as well as his literary craft.\n\nThe Big Hole museum dates mining at its site to 1871.

It later describes David Rawdon\'s restoration work and the hotel\'s reopening in 1970. A building can have several uses across a lifetime; its present appearance alone cannot tell them all.\n\nThis chapter is based on the property\'s published history, not a new interview with local residents.

### My role

**Lindokuhle Nyoka — Solutionist (solution lead)** for the GKHack26 team.

### Team

Built together with [Gift Vundla](https://github.com/GIft-Vundla) and [ThandiAlgorithm](https://github.com/ThandiAlgorithm). Team repository: [GIft-Vundla/ShosholozaTrail](https://github.com/GIft-Vundla/ShosholozaTrail).

### Highlights

- Offline-first PWA you open from a QR code — no app install needed on the train
- Rail map built from an OpenStreetMap rail graph: 76,536 coordinates, 1,582 km, eight mapped stations
- Stories, activities, saved postcards and a waiting mode that still work with no signal
- Optional, source-locked AI guide (Workers AI) that only answers from registered sources
- Moderated community contributions with role-based admin access
- 191 automated tests passing on the deployed release

ShosholozaTrail is an install-free, offline-first journey companion for the Pretoria–Cape Town story corridor. The pilot combines a foreground GPS or clearly labelled synthetic replay pipeline, locally packaged stories and activities, a truthful waiting mode, saved postcards, an online carriage board, a moderated contribution workflow, and an in-product evidence console.

The current build is **working towards TRL 5; validation is incomplete**. It does not claim corridor field validation, physical-phone acceptance, operator integration, community endorsement, second-language readiness, or demonstrated tourism and income impact. The mapped rail candidate is graph-connected and source-backed, but the current or historic passenger itinerary still needs human or organiser review.

## Pilot architecture

The pilot uses a React PWA and a companion journey-engine shell with vendored MapLibre and Turf assets, Cloudflare Workers and D1. This differs intentionally from the React Native/Supabase scale architecture in the original team profile: the pilot favors install-free QR entry, HTTPS hosting, offline use and a low-cost deployment path. The native scale architecture remains roadmap work.

AI remains optional. The `/ai` consultation page and chapter-level source finder use a clearly labelled, source-locked Workers AI mode while keeping the release-validation flag false. The guide keeps conversation history in the current page, links its cited source, and can only select an exact excerpt from one registered source; unsupported questions are declined and draft sources carry a human-review-pending label. Prepared stories, source passages, deterministic challenge answers, hints, journey triggers, waiting mode and saved work remain usable without it. The AI, room and moderation APIs are online-only and are explicitly excluded from service-worker caching.

The overview and `/ride` use an automated OpenStreetMap rail-graph candidate with 76,536 detailed coordinates, seven connected station-to-station segments and eight mapped station anchors. Its measured length is 1,582.4 km. This establishes mapped geometric continuity; it must not be presented as a confirmed current service, timetable, live train position, permission to alight, or safety advice.

## Run and verify locally

Requirements: Node.js 22 or newer and a Cloudflare account for deployed Worker/D1 checks.

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run check
npm run harness:r3
node harness/run-corridor-traces.js
npm run harness:ai
npm run build
npm run security:scan
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Wrangler. Use **Run labelled replay** for a conference-room demonstration; the UI labels this source as synthetic replay at all times. **Start live GPS** requests foreground browser geolocation and does not imply background or locked-screen support.

`npm run harness:r3` samples synthetic movement across every sourced story zone on the shipped curved OSM rail candidate and writes `results/r3.json`; it is not phone GPS or field evidence. `npm run harness:ai` without `--provider` verifies only the disabled fallback and keeps R10 at `NOT RUN`; the experimental binding does not turn that fallback run into provider evidence. `npm run security:scan` requires `dist/`, scans the working tree, public and built output, and Git patch history, and reports binary artifacts that still require manual review.

## Deployment

Configure the D1 binding and apply `migrations/0001.sql`, then deploy with Wrangler. The Workers AI binding uses the Cloudflare account directly and requires no provider secret. The experiment sets `AI_ENABLED=true`, `AI_EXPERIMENTAL=true`, and keeps `AI_VALIDATED=false`; this permits local source-locked testing without claiming the fixed 30/10/10 provider gate has passed. If another provider is used later, keep its credential in a Cloudflare Worker secret and never place it in `.dev.vars`, repository files, browser assets, screenshots or evidence exports.

Satellite imagery uses Esri as the keyless fallback. An optional free MapTiler account can raise configured satellite detail to native zoom 20: run `npx wrangler secret put MAPTILER_KEY`, paste the key only into Wrangler's protected prompt, and redeploy. The key is returned only inside uncached runtime map configuration and is never bundled. The current Cloudflare environment has no `MAPTILER_KEY`, so the deployed fallback remains Esri; hybrid labels come from keyless OpenFreeMap vector tiles.

T1 passes only when all of the following are retained for the exact release:

- the public HTTPS URL and `/api/health` response;
- a clean built-output and repository-history secret scan;
- a physical phone make/model, OS, browser, tested URL/build and observed result.

A desktop or local response does not complete the phone gate. Local work on later components is allowed while this remains pending, but it does not advance the ordered release gates.

## Evidence and source status

- `evidence/acceptance.md` freezes requirements R1–R16 and records the release-gate policy.
- `evidence/journey-design.md` defines the common GPS/replay engine contract and pre-test criteria.
- `evidence/research-notes.md` records route/content provenance and review limits.
- `results/r3.json` contains the primary synthetic trigger profiles sampled from the shipped mapped rail geometry, with failure classes and route hash.
- `results/r10.json` keeps provider AI grounding at `NOT RUN` and separately identifies the local fallback check.

Every factual chapter points to `data/sources.json`. Entries are original paraphrases with attribution and rights notes, but human editorial approval remains pending. `data/route.geojson`, its provenance record and the trace headers distinguish the mapped candidate from synthetic movement and field evidence. Preserve those labels in screenshots, slides and exports.

## Scope limits

This pilot includes eight mapped ride arrivals, three deep sourced hubs (Kimberley, Beaufort West and Matjiesfontein), and four short sourced chapters (Pretoria, De Aar, Worcester/Zwelethemba and Cape Town). Johannesburg is a mapped arrival with overview copy and no source-backed chapter trigger. The `/ride` uses satellite, terrain and OpenFreeMap context online. Its verified 1.6 MB rail geometry, controls, discoveries, arrival photographs and a simplified local rail-world renderer are included in the offline pack; external imagery and terrain tiles are not bulk-downloaded. The pilot does not include bookings, payments, live operator or timetable feeds, automatic passenger matching, native builds, background geolocation, cached third-party tile archives, unlimited AI or unreviewed languages.

The earlier `ShosholozaTrail_Interactive_HTML_Prototype.html` remains an art-direction storyboard. It contains simulated interactions and is not the pilot application or acceptance evidence. The working pilot is served from `public/` through the Worker.
